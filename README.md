##  Technical Challenges & Solutions

###  Password hashing error (bcrypt 72-byte limit)

**Solution:** truncated passwords to 72 bytes and upgraded bcrypt library.

###  JWT token decoding issues

**Solution:** standardized secret key, algorithm, and improved token validator.

###  401 Unauthorized on /me endpoint

**Solution:** Corrected dependency injection and ensured Authorization header required.
